# Setting up Strapi

### Quickstart

###### This section only works for mac and linux

Windows sections will be added later. For now check out these links to set up:

- Windows: https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_0/MediaServer/Guides/html/English/Content/Getting_Started/Configure/_TRN_Set_up_PostgreSQL.htm

#### Setting up database for Mac users

##### Installing HomeBrew

1. Install Homebrew by running command: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`. _(This will ask for you password and confirmation of download)_
2. Check that homebrew is up to date and healty by running: `brew update` then `brew doctor`

##### Installing postgres

3. Install Postgres by running: `brew install postgresql`
4. Start Postgres service by running: `brew services start postgresql`
5. If you get error: "Error: role 'postgres' does not exist", run command: `/usr/local/opt/postgres/bin/createuser -s postgres`

_Remember to run `npm run build` and `npm run develop` after doing these steps._

_PS: The step “Downloading Command Line Tools for Xcode” can take very long._
My best suggestion for that is checking out this discussion: https://github.com/Homebrew/discussions/discussions/131

And especially this comment:

Apple's XCode command-line installer is...quite uncommunicative. You have at least two choices: 1. Wait for as long as it takes...or the installer errors out. 2. Go to https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ (you'll need to sign up for an Apple developer account if you don't have one), then download and install the latest Command Line Tools package that your OS supports.

### Import database

After setting up strapi, you need to import the database. This is how you do that.

1. First, add the database file to the native layer in your repo. It should be named something like “backup-remote-….-.pgsql”
2. In your terminal, go into postgres: `psql template0`
3. Check roles: `\du`
   - You will most likely see that you are a "superuser" in some databases, some not. This gives special admin rights to the database, which you will need
4. Create database for this project, call it "acc-v4": `CREATE DATABASE "acc-v4"`.
5. Make yourself a superuser: `alter user [username] with superuser`.
6. Add login permission: `alter role [username] with login`
7. Exit postgres: `\q`
8. Import the database: `pg_restore -U [username] -d acc-v4 -1 [name-of-file]`
9. Run `yarn build` and then `yarn develop`. You should now be set up. Go to http://localhost:1337/admin/ (Or whatever localhost it is running on) and check!

#### Notes:

- To import the database correctly, it needs to be totally empty when you do it. When you are not familiar with PostgreSQL it is easy to type wrong, make small mistakes etc., which can lead to the database not being ready to import when you try. This can be easily solved by deleting the database `DROP DATABASE [name-of-database]` and creating a new one `CREATE DATABASE [name-of-database]`. This will give you a clean slate to try importing again.
- Always remember `;` at the end of your lines, commands in PostgreSQL wont run without them. If you forget, just type `;` in the next line and press `ENTER`.
- Backslash is achieved with `SHIFT+OPTION+7`on a Mac.

### More info

Most of the steps here are taken directly from this website: https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew-and-lunchy/. There is more to learn there.

HomeBrew is a package manager that takes care of everything NPM or Yarn doesn´t. Read more about it on https://brew.sh/

It will ask for your password and to confirm the download.

Beware that the step “Downloading Command Line Tools for Xcode” can take very long. My best suggestion for that is checking out this discussion:

Don´t worry, it takes some time, but will complete in the end.

After all this, you might get the error: “error: role "postgres" does not exist”

To solve that, simply run this in the command line:

/usr/local/opt/postgres/bin/createuser -s postgres

Then, run "yarn build” and "yarn develop” again and you should be good!

### Useful git commands

When you work on this project, you will du that on your own fork. You will make branches for each added feature, push changes and then merge the branches when the feature are reviewed by others. Here is a breakdown of your workflow:

1. Set upstream repo. Olivers repo is our "source of truth": `git remote add upstream git@github.com:oriooctopus/acc-v4.git`
2. Pull master - make sure you´re up to date: `git pull`
3. Make a branch for the change you´re about to make: `git checkout -b [name-of-branch]`
4. Make the changes/Write the code
5. Add changes with `git add [name-of-file`
6. Commit changes with `git commit -m "[notes about changes]"`
7. Push changes: `git push origin HEAD`
8. Go to github and make a pull request for your changes.

#### Notes

In general there is some thing you need to learn about working with git. Don´t be afraid to ask. You should also go through this tutorial on git branching, it is very helpful: https://learngitbranching.js.org/

- Git Lens is a very helpful VSCode extension: Go install it. (Add picture etc.)
- When you have made your branch, you can check your branches by entering this command: `git branch`. It will also tell you which branch you are on.
- When you have made a pull request on a branch and make more changes. Don´t make another pull request, it will update when you push the new changes.
- When you type git rebase -I HEAD~[num] you, for some fucking unknown reason, enter this vim fuckery. Without a fucking course you will also be stuck there and god forbid the changes you want to make will actually be made. So, here is a little guide for how to deal with this godforsaken dickcheese of a feature.
  - :q - no changes were made
  - :q! - trash all changes
  - :wq - save the changes and quit
